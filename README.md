# Dyslexia Simulator for Sketch
See how your designs might feel for someone who struggles to read. Design inclusively.

Dyslexia Simulator rearranges the letters within words on a page, making it difficult to read. It's intended help designers see how their designs hold up for users who have a learning disability, are ELS, or are simply distracted. It's not intended to show what it’s like to have Dyslexia, but instead how it may feel when struggling to process information. 

Designing for users with learning disabilities and cognitive impairments results in better design for everyone. 

## How to Install
1. Download the ZIP file and unzip
2. Open the SketchMoveHalfPixel.sketchplugin

## How to use
Select an artboard, toggle Dyslexia Simulator, and watch the letters move. You can still make out the words, but reading is difficult. Toggle off to stop the shuffling and return to the original state.

## Note about Dyslexia
There is no single “dyslexia experience”, and this plugin is not intended to tokenize the experience of anyone with Dyslexia.
